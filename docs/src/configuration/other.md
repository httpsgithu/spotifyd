## Caching

You can enable audio data caching by setting a `--cache-path` / `cache_path` and limit its size with `--max-cache-size` / `max_cache_size`.

## MPRIS

On linux desktop systems, you can enable `--use-mpris` / `use_mpris` (if your version has enabled that feature). This will give your desktop environment or tools like `playerctl` the option to display information about and control `spotifyd`.
